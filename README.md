What is Inverto?
-------

Inverto is a puzzle-platformer on the iPhone where the objective is to collect all tokens in each level. To reach your goal, you must use the power of inverting the world! When seen in a different light, an obstacle may turn into an advantage...

Game Play
-------
The player controls a ball rolling around, and jumping in a side scrolling world. The goal is to collect a number of tokens in each stage. In each stage the player is presented with a set of obstacles that must be overcome in order to reach each token. But these obstacles aren't necessarily always obstacles - the player has the ability to invert, or "change dimension" of, the stage. When the stage is inverted, obstacles may change into advantages, and new paths may become visible.

The game is separated into a sequence of stages of increasing difficulty, and new elements are introduced, or combined in different ways, in each stage.

Controls
-------

Left/Right rolling - tilt the device left/right.

Jump - Tap the screen.

Invert world - Swipe up/down.

Technology
--------
Inverto will be available for iOS, specifically targeting the iPhone. It will be programmed with Cocos2D for iPhone (http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/) using its built in tools, such as physics from box2d.
